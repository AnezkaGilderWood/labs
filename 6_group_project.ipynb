How the project is implemented is up to the group (e.g. there is not requirement that you must use an object orientated approach, but the project will be evaluated on these criteria\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Create a GitHub repository for your software, you will need to pick one person to host it and a good name. They can then add all other members using the setting/Collaborators tab.\n",
    "2. Working together, create a list of issues (see the `issues` tab) planning out the development of the project. This need not be complete as new issues can be created as an when. A good initial issue might be \"Set up the basic python project\".\n",
    "3. Assign the issues to team members - they should then resolve the issues applying the concepts of GitHub Flow (i.e. create Pull Requests, request review, then merge once it is complete).\n",
    "4. Iterate 2-3 until you are ready to submit the project.\n",
    "5. To submit the project, email Greg Ashton with a link to your GitHub repository. All marks will be assigned for project as it exists on the submission day, and subsequent changes will be ignored. Note that marks can only be assigned for work which is clearly accessible via the GitHub link, so be sure to add a `README.md` explaining where to find all the parts of the software."
