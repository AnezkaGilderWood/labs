# Using the RHUL Physics Lab machines

The lab computers come pre-installed with all the software needed for this group project. This tutorial will walk you through how to use it.

## Starting Jupyter notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `Start > Anaconda 3 (64 bit) > Jupyter Notebook`
2. This will usually start in internet explorer, if you wish to open it in another browser, switch to the "Jupyter Notebook" window (see example below) and copy and paste one of the URLs as instructed.

3. Finally you should have the Jupyter notebook landing page in a browser window: I'll call this the "Jupyter browser window" from hereon out.

## Using the command line
While there are Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) available, here we will learn how to use git from the command line, but first we need to access the command line.
Both Windows and UNIX systems (i.e. linux or Macs) have a command line, but they are different. Since these machines are Windows machines, we'll be using the Windows command line!

There are several ways to access it, but the easiest is from Jupyter:
1. Hit the "New" button in the top right hand of the Jupyter browser window.
2. Hit "Terminal" (this is another name for command line)
3. This will open a new tab with a black window, this is the command line.
4. You can now review [the guide to the command line](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/using_the_command_line.md) for some general advice on its use. However, **note that `du` is not available in the Windows command line**. 

## Using git and python at the command

You are now ready to use git and python from the command line: they are preinstalled
1. To check what version of python is installed, run `python --version`, like this:

2. To start a python REPL, type the command `python`, this will drop you to the shell like this

   To exit python, type `exit()`
   
3. Finally, you can use git in the same way, e.g. type `git --version`

## Final steps

* Okay, now that you no how to access the command line on the lab machines, [please follow Step 8 and Step 9](https://github.com/GregoryAshton/PH3010_advanced_python/blob/main/guides/getting_setup.md#step-8-getting-a-github-account) in the getting started guide. You may find it useful to browse the rest of the instructions which show how to get python and git installed on your own machine.
